🚌 Livingston Bus Stop Finder
Find the nearest bus stop to any building on Livingston Campus, Rutgers University — showing both walking and driving distance and time!

📋 Project Overview
This project is designed to help Rutgers students, especially new freshmen, easily locate the closest bus stop from any building on Livingston campus.
It uses real geographic data, and an optimized A* (A-Star) search algorithm to find the shortest paths for both walking and driving.

🚀 Features
Search by building name (e.g., Tillet Hall, Beck Hall)

Find nearest bus stop based on:

Walking distance and time

Driving distance and time

Visual map view (coming soon)

Fast and lightweight frontend

Real pathfinding using A* algorithm
